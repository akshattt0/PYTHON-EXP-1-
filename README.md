# Experiment 2: Introduction to Python Programming

---

## Aim

To understand the basics of Python programming and become familiar with the Python programming environment, syntax, variables, data types, operators, and simple input/output operations.

---

## Objectives

- To study the Python programming environment and its interfaces  
- To understand how Python programs are executed  
- To learn the use of comments in Python  
- To understand variables and identifier naming rules  
- To explore basic data types in Python  
- To perform operations using different operators  
- To implement simple input and output statements

## Theory

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.  
It can be executed using different platforms such as the Python shell, Jupyter Notebook, and various IDEs.

Python supports two main execution modes:
- **Interactive Mode**, where statements are executed line by line
- **Script Mode**, where a complete program is written and executed at once

Comments are used in Python to explain code and improve clarity. Single-line comments begin with the `#` symbol, while multi-line comments are written using triple quotes.

Variables are used to store data values and do not require explicit declaration of data types due to Python’s dynamic typing feature. Python provides several built-in data types such as integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and boolean values.

Operators allow calculations and logical operations to be performed on data. Python supports arithmetic, relational, logical, assignment, and bitwise operators.

Input and output operations enable interaction between the user and the program. The `input()` function is used to accept input from the user, while the `print()` function is used to display output.

## Conclusion

Thus, the basic concepts of Python programming including execution modes, variables, data types, operators, comments, and basic input/output operations were studied and successfully implemented through this experiment.
